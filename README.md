## Abstract
This project focuses on developing a robust forecasting framework for Valmont's domestic agriculture accounts receivable for the Treasury Department to help improve business operations and rigorize the forecasting process. Due to Valmont’s nascent development in data science, there was limited immediate data to be utilized. Given the limited dataset—only a few years of daily records—time series modeling was employed to generate predictions on weekly and monthly timeframes. Initial efforts involved using a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast the cash flows of a single bank account that contained the bulk of transactions. The model demonstrated high diagnostic reliability and was subsequently generalized to a group of accounts encompassing almost all of the receivables. To further enhance the predictive accuracy, the SARIMA-generated forecasts were integrated with additional temporal features and processed using an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model. The hybrid approach effectively combined the strengths of traditional time series analysis with advanced predictive analytics. This framework offers a scalable methodology for financial forecasting in the context of sparse data, with potential applications in broader operational and strategic financial planning across all of Valmont’s areas of production.
